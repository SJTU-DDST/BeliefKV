# BeliefKV Current Execution Plan

Status date: 2026-10-05.

This is the active plan, not a chronological log. The previous detailed plan
is available at `c219604:docs/implementation_plan.md`; older snapshots remain
under `docs/archive/`. Current design, implementation evidence and execution
constraints must agree across `beliefkv_design.md`, `architecture_status_zh.md`
and `experiment_operating_notes_zh.md`.

## 1. Current Objective

On Qwen3.5-35B-A3B / SGLang 0.5.20, validate selective PREPARE_HOST and
JOIN/tool-return predictive H2D using real recoverable Host-only safe inputs.
Model heads predict phase, remaining work or external completion time;
runtime decides actions from identity, capacity, service and opportunity cost.
Do not train an offline net-benefit head or promote old eligibility metadata.

The user authorizes 84 roots in one arrival wave. Running stays 48, Host
stays 200 GB on NUMA node 1, and FULL/Mamba pool settings stay fixed.
Do not change to 128, staggered 64+64 or artificial eviction.
More traffic is not inherently more useful traffic: report first-use,
exposed restore waiting, advance residency, Host churn and recomputation.

Development uses only the current single live pair. Multi-pair averaging is
a later formal-experiment requirement, not a reason to slow development.
Fixed-demand GPU replay and deterministic-kernel migration are not required
or active mainline tasks.

## 2. Frozen v5 Development Pair

- Directory: `experiments/raw/qwen35_joint_wait_h2d_ab_84root_20261005_v5`.
- Code at launch: `c219604`, including runtime fixes `1aba1be`.
- Order: reactive, then predictive_h2d; no queued repetitions.
- Same manifest first 84 tasks, single arrival, temperature 0, seed 21.
- Context 131072, completion 8192, workflow 14400 seconds.
- Graph 2048, accepted 32-step finalization reserve.
- Native-reactive guard profile, natural-language child/root returns.
- Both arms share completion notice/final-report control and priority,
  waiting-state preparation and real-pressure demotion.
- Only predictive enables JOIN and tool-return predictive loads.
- Predicted lead window: 1000 ms; actual submission lead is audited separately.
- Fresh server, cache and per-workflow workspace in each arm.

This isolates early restoration over a shared residency policy; it is not
an untouched native baseline or a complete old-algorithm ablation.
Do not edit runtime, prompts, weights, kernels or launch arguments mid-pair.
Documentation-only maintenance must leave the runtime source fingerprint
and experiment launch record unchanged.

## 3. Immediate Work

1. Monitor the single 84-root pair for real serving/ledger/writer failures
   and disk pressure. Stop genuine system failures; do not truncate merely
   because a legitimate task is long or add an agent guard.
2. Inspect tool-prefetch candidates, remaining-time forecasts and actual
   controller submissions relative to TOOL_END. Native D2H copies qualify;
   PREPARE consumption is not a prerequisite.
3. Link PREPARE issue/ACK to real pressure demotion and later first-use,
   separately for FULL and Mamba. Do not label all duplicate eviction waste.
4. Verify deferred ancestry inspection, bounded wait-query refresh,
   opportunity cache revalidation, and no extra overlap drain after ACK.
5. Check pre-EOS work-upper-bound policy, native tool-marker invalidation,
   stale packet suppression and true RETURN lead. No widening the 50 ms
   EOS protocol window to count already returned children.
6. Report baseline and predictive realized work and phase-dependent
   utilization. A single live pair cannot establish stable throughput benefit.
7. After terminal summaries, clean only archived completed workspaces,
   retaining traces, patches, configuration and failure scenes.

## 4. Known v4 Findings

Both arms completed 64/64. Predictive/Reactive duration was 4219.81/3032.21
seconds, mean JCT 1614.74/1341.92 seconds, completed throughput
54.60/75.98 workflows per hour. No independent task grading was performed.
Predictive produced 6 tagged H2D ACKs, all FULL first-use verified; 5 Mamba
forward uses verified. Tool H2D remained zero despite 12 tool-wait demotions.

Do not explain the negative result only as random model-path variation:
NVML accounting identifies a roughly 896-second last-workflow tail on
django-16938, including two 600-second whole-Django-suite commands.
There is also a smaller utilization gap during nonempty serving demand.
See the existing v4 report and `experiments/analysis/v4_gpu_root_cause_20261005.json`.
Scheduler/worker service intervals are not CUDA kernel time.

Already implemented after v4:

- The configured tool P50 window is no longer vetoed by CDF >= 0.8.
- Timing-only hint acceptance defers expensive physical ancestry inspection.
- Fast and unchanged long waits do not submit at every decode tick.
- Physical opportunity reads are briefly cached but revalidated before enqueue.
- A completed tool load does not drain overlap again for already restored pages.
- Pre-EOS JOIN decisions use the existing remaining-work upper bound.

These CPU-tested fixes are included in v5, not retrospectively in v4.
Their GPU benefit remains to be measured.

## 5. Next Changes After The Pair

Prioritize evidenced bottlenecks rather than another blind pressure increase:

1. Explicit, truthful timeout feedback distinguishing configured tool timeout,
   host timeout and unknown process failure. Preserve normal long tools.
2. Pipeline upstream failure propagation instead of reporting a failing Python
   test as success because `tail` returned 0. Validate shell compatibility.
3. Low-overhead scheduler-stage/profile spans for model-result handling,
   ancestry inspection, packet processing and native transfer preparation.
   Use matched nonempty-demand phases and account for instrumentation overhead.
4. Tool timing/features only if the candidate audit proves residual-time
   failure. Known command deadline is observable information, not the label
   of a natural early tool completion.
5. Work-head improvements only on workflow-separated data, keeping the
   deployed phase encoder stable; do not deploy rejected candidates.

Do not change these during frozen v5 or reintroduce repeat/format guards.
Do not reduce every tool's timeout simply to improve the makespan metric.

## 6. Formal Evaluation Later

Run multiple independent live pairs using the same task set and settings;
alternate arm order, retain all failures/censors and show every pair plus
mean and variation. The unit for whole-run throughput uncertainty is a run
or pair, not all workflows sharing that run's GPU.
Do not require fixed-demand replay, do not discard divergent trajectories,
and do not divide JCT by realized token counts as a posthoc correction.
Completion curves, mean/median/tail JCT and independently graded correctness
should accompany makespan throughput.

Before final testing, freeze workload stratum from actual recoverable targets,
FULL/Mamba capacity and useful eviction/recompute evidence, not root count alone.
Complete algorithm/native baseline/prepare/early-load ablations must be named
explicitly; their controls are not interchangeable.

## 7. Deferred Scope

- Full legacy COMMIT_CPU/JointPlan/selective running retraction migration.
- Joint victim/beneficiary handoff and critical-path hot-page preemption.
- Host value models, SSD tiering, KV FP8 and another engine/model migration.
- Online model updates without stable timing/physical validation.
- Hidden-state probes without demonstrated low extraction cost.
- GPU fixed-demand replay as a non-required optional research branch.

## 8. Documentation Rule

Update current design/status/plan/operating constraints together when changing
mainline direction. Experiment reports preserve dated evidence, not competing
current defaults. Keep actual SHA/configuration in each run's launch record.
Do not leave an old "current" section naming a 36-root/canary/old-model
workflow while a different configuration is active.

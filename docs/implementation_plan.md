# BeliefKV Current Execution Plan

Status date: 2026-10-06.

This is the active plan, not a chronological log. The previous detailed plan
is available at `c219604:docs/implementation_plan.md`; older snapshots remain
under `docs/archive/`. Current design, implementation evidence and execution
constraints must agree across `beliefkv_design.md`, `architecture_status_zh.md`
and `experiment_operating_notes_zh.md`.

## 1. Current Objective

On Qwen3.5-35B-A3B / SGLang 0.5.20, validate selective PREPARE_HOST and
JOIN/tool-return predictive H2D using real recoverable Host-only safe inputs.
Model heads predict phase, remaining work or external completion time;
runtime decides actions from identity, capacity, service and opportunity cost.
Do not train an offline net-benefit head or promote old eligibility metadata.

The user authorizes 84 roots in one arrival wave. Running stays 48, Host
stays 200 GB on NUMA node 1, and FULL/Mamba pool settings stay fixed.
Do not change to 128, staggered 64+64 or artificial eviction.
More traffic is not inherently more useful traffic: report first-use,
exposed restore waiting, advance residency, Host churn and recomputation.

The single v6 development pair is complete: both arms finished 84/84. Seven
JOIN loads actually reused FULL without re-parking/native reload; all were
post-EOS and tool loads stayed zero. The observed +4.62% completed throughput
comes with less realized work and is not an isolated KV speedup. Work-only
refits and first-trigger audits are complete with the phase head/encoder frozen.
A separate observed-final-body path avoids requiring NN results or TPS
after a normal no-tool stop.
No extra repetitions are queued.
Multi-pair averaging is
a later formal-experiment requirement, not a reason to slow development.
Fixed-demand GPU replay and deterministic-kernel migration are not required
or active mainline tasks.

## 2. Frozen v5 Development Pair

- Status: complete; reactive 84 completed, predictive 83 completed/1 incomplete.
- Directory: `experiments/raw/qwen35_joint_wait_h2d_ab_84root_20261005_v5`.
- Code at launch: `c219604`, including runtime fixes `1aba1be`.
- Order: reactive, then predictive_h2d; no queued repetitions.
- Same manifest first 84 tasks, single arrival, temperature 0, seed 21.
- Context 131072, completion 8192, workflow 14400 seconds.
- Graph 2048, accepted 32-step finalization reserve.
- Native-reactive guard profile, natural-language child/root returns.
- Both arms share completion notice/final-report control and priority,
  waiting-state preparation and real-pressure demotion.
- Only predictive enables JOIN and tool-return predictive loads.
- Predicted lead window: 1000 ms; actual submission lead is audited separately.
- Fresh server, cache and per-workflow workspace in each arm.

This isolates early restoration over a shared residency policy; it is not
an untouched native baseline or a complete old-algorithm ablation.
Predictive also supplies forecast-dependent stage state and CPU processing;
the pair is not a DMA-only counterfactual.
Do not edit runtime, prompts, weights, kernels or launch arguments mid-pair.
Documentation-only maintenance must leave the runtime source fingerprint
and experiment launch record unchanged.

## 3. Immediate Work

1. V6 lifecycle audit complete: all seven JOIN FULL targets actually reused;
   no own re-demotion/native reload. Two soft leases expired before eventual
   reuse, so expiration is not a miss. No new tool load means its post-ACK
   GPU behavior remains unverified.
2. Work-interval repair complete: retain legacy clip-then-expand semantics
   for old artifacts; expand signed residuals then clip only in explicitly
   versioned and recalibrated candidates. The isolated repair did not improve
   point MAE or provide earlier v6 replay triggers.
3. Fit only the work head using v6 intrinsic remaining-token labels and real
   100 ms snapshots, keeping phase/encoder/threshold frozen. Compare a small
   log-work quantile head to the deployed head and linear refit.
4. Audit first triggers, tool-round errors, early residence and actual
   recoverable targets. Runtime may explicitly compare center/upper timing;
   legacy defaults stay upper. Do not turn a whole-trajectory uncertainty
   bound into a blanket action veto or zero work into EOS.
5. Commit source and select one measured candidate before one same-config
   v7 live pair. Keep all 84 tasks, pools/running/prompts/budgets; no blind
   rerun, canary, artificial eviction, concurrency increase or repeat queue.
   Models still do not learn offline action net benefit.
6. Keep exposed restore waiting and block-attribution overflow as explicit
   measurement gaps. Host is full in both arms; aggregate hit >95% cannot
   certify low useful recomputation. Preserve both positive and negative runs.

V6 is complete and remains frozen as evidence; work refits do not backfill it.
V6 becomes training replay when added to the fit. Astropy/Sphinx are reused
project-disjoint development sets, not newly sealed evaluation.
v6 directory: `experiments/raw/qwen35_joint_wait_h2d_ab_84root_20261006_v6`.
Launch commit: `573f32c`. Runtime fingerprint:
`c65caec44ecc934cd5cff9d740ec96f19459f48527505c85927bd4ae969fd6b9`.
Candidate plan: `configs/migration/child_semantic_work_live_v7.json`.
V6 findings: `docs/experiments/joint_tool_join_h2d_v6_84root_zh.md`.
V7 development plan: `configs/migration/qwen35_v7_work_development.json`.
Choose unweighted log quantiles using the Astropy selector, center=500 ms
and the explicitly logged EOS protocol window=250 ms. Native EOS evidence
is not model prediction success. Reweighted body features remain a candidate.
165 related CPU tests pass; the next one-pair GPU check must retain all
workflows and actual transfer/reuse/trajectory evidence.

## 4. Latest v5 Findings

Completed throughput is 68.75/62.59 workflows per hour (reactive/predictive),
so predictive is -8.95%. Paired completed mean JCT is 1929.83/1759.18 seconds
(-8.84%), but LLM/tool/input demand also differs; no causal speedup claim.
GPU utilization is 76.50/81.66%, not the v4 low-utilization pattern. The
predictive tail with only two workflows lasts about 899 seconds and remains
busy; high utilization alone does not imply high batched throughput.

17 tagged H2D ACKs total 1.298 GB: 11 JOIN loads all reuse FULL, while six tool
loads do not. All JOIN submits follow native EOS; six are within 1 second of
RETURN. Tool submits precede TOOL_END by 3.70-7.11 seconds, then are demoted
94-1652 ms after ACK. 38 pressure-demotion events have prior PREPARE ACKs on
32 nodes, including loops, so consumption exists but is not a net-benefit result.
Both arms have 113 children and joins with no child cancellation; multi-round
roots number 19/15, every round still has one child.
The sole incomplete root loops in its last 8192-token, length-ended response;
it is not a format guard, expired deadline or old graph=512 configuration.

See `docs/experiments/joint_tool_join_h2d_v5_84root_zh.md` and the existing
pair's comparison/window files. Serving/ledger/writer failures were absent.

## 5. Known v4 Findings

Both arms completed 64/64. Predictive/Reactive duration was 4219.81/3032.21
seconds, mean JCT 1614.74/1341.92 seconds, completed throughput
54.60/75.98 workflows per hour. No independent task grading was performed.
Predictive produced 6 tagged H2D ACKs, all FULL first-use verified; 5 Mamba
forward uses verified. Tool H2D remained zero despite 12 tool-wait demotions.

Do not explain the negative result only as random model-path variation:
NVML accounting identifies a roughly 896-second last-workflow tail on
django-16938, including two 600-second whole-Django-suite commands.
There is also a smaller utilization gap during nonempty serving demand.
See the existing v4 report and `experiments/analysis/v4_gpu_root_cause_20261005.json`.
Scheduler/worker service intervals are not CUDA kernel time.

Already implemented after v4:

- The configured tool P50 window is no longer vetoed by CDF >= 0.8.
- Timing-only hint acceptance defers expensive physical ancestry inspection.
- Fast and unchanged long waits do not submit at every decode tick.
- Physical opportunity reads are briefly cached but revalidated before enqueue.
- A completed tool load does not drain overlap again for already restored pages.
- Pre-EOS JOIN decisions use the existing remaining-work upper bound.

These CPU-tested fixes are included in v5, not retrospectively in v4.
v5 confirms deferred hint inspection and immediate submission. Tool loads
are now issued, but conflict with parking; pre-EOS JOIN loads remain absent.
This does not independently prove throughput benefit from those fixes.

## 6. Other Next Changes

Prioritize evidenced bottlenecks rather than another blind pressure increase:

1. Explicit, truthful timeout feedback distinguishing configured tool timeout,
   host timeout and unknown process failure. Preserve normal long tools.
2. Pipeline upstream failure propagation instead of reporting a failing Python
   test as success because `tail` returned 0. Validate shell compatibility.
3. Low-overhead scheduler-stage/profile spans for model-result handling,
   ancestry inspection, packet processing and native transfer preparation.
   Use matched nonempty-demand phases and account for instrumentation overhead.
4. Tool timing/features only if the candidate audit proves residual-time
   failure. Known command deadline is observable information, not the label
   of a natural early tool completion.
5. Work-head improvements only on workflow-separated data, keeping the
   deployed phase encoder stable; do not deploy rejected candidates.

Do not retrospectively change completed v5 or reintroduce repeat/format guards.
Do not reduce every tool's timeout simply to improve the makespan metric.

## 7. Formal Evaluation Later

Run multiple independent live pairs using the same task set and settings;
alternate arm order, retain all failures/censors and show every pair plus
mean and variation. The unit for whole-run throughput uncertainty is a run
or pair, not all workflows sharing that run's GPU.
Do not require fixed-demand replay, do not discard divergent trajectories,
and do not divide JCT by realized token counts as a posthoc correction.
Completion curves, mean/median/tail JCT and independently graded correctness
should accompany makespan throughput.

Before final testing, freeze workload stratum from actual recoverable targets,
FULL/Mamba capacity and useful eviction/recompute evidence, not root count alone.
Complete algorithm/native baseline/prepare/early-load ablations must be named
explicitly; their controls are not interchangeable.

## 8. Deferred Scope

- Full legacy COMMIT_CPU/JointPlan/selective running retraction migration.
- Joint victim/beneficiary handoff and critical-path hot-page preemption.
- Host value models, SSD tiering, KV FP8 and another engine/model migration.
- Online model updates without stable timing/physical validation.
- Hidden-state probes without demonstrated low extraction cost.
- GPU fixed-demand replay as a non-required optional research branch.

## 9. Documentation Rule

Update current design/status/plan/operating constraints together when changing
mainline direction. Experiment reports preserve dated evidence, not competing
current defaults. Keep actual SHA/configuration in each run's launch record.
Do not leave an old "current" section naming a 36-root/canary/old-model
workflow while a different configuration is active.
